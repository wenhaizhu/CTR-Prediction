% We want to perform weighted least squares. We do this by computing a sum
% of squares and cross products matrix
%      M = (X'*W*X) = (X1'*W1*X1) + (X2'*W2*X2) + ... + (Xn'*Wn*Xn)
% where X = X1;X2;...;Xn]  and  W = [W1;W2;...;Wn].

% The mapper has computed the the terms on the right hand side. Here in the
% reducer we just add them up.

% Compute coefficients estimates from M. M is a matrix of sums of squares
% and cross products for [X Y] where X is the design matrix including a
% constant term and Y is the adjusted response for this iteration. In other
% words, Y has been included as an additional column of X. First we
% separate them by extracting the X'*W*X part and the X'*W*Y part.

% Solve the normal equations.

% Return the vector of coefficient estimates.
